# Gallery4
My first Android app, the gallery displays all the pictures and videos of the user ordered by date and allows users to share them as well

An Android platform based application which gives user the most recent pictures added and also the photos grouped in folders. The app also gives the functionality to share the pictures and also to set them as the contact icon or wallpaper. This was my first Android app. Huge learning experience came along with ways to identify errors and my own creativity in designing the UI and the functionality of the app considering what I was capable of doing.
